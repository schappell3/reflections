What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created in the location of the repository.  The .git directory stores the files necessary to keep track and commits and other git funtions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a necessary step before creating a new commit that allows the user to select files for the commit.  This helps the user make the commit as logical as possible.
