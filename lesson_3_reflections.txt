When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are colloborating with other programs to work on the same project.  Everyone is able to contribute changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually gives the user more control.  Maybe you don't have internet access at the time.  For a large project GitHub may be updating constantly.
