When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are colloborating with other programs to work on the same project.  Everyone is able to contribute changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually gives the user more control.  Maybe you don't have internet access at the time.  For a large project GitHub may be updating constantly.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is when you make a copy of a repository.  A fork is also a copy of a repository but it exists with relation to GitHub.  A branch is a different set if commits on a single repository.  You would clone a repository if you wanted to take it to your local machine to make changes to it.  You would fork a repository if you wanted to make changes to a repository on someone else's GitHub account and you don't have permission to change their repository.  You would make a new branch in a repository if you are working on a new experimental feature for your program that you don't won't to interfere with the main branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If the user doesn't have internet access they still have a copy of the last known changes to work with without having them merged into the last commit.
